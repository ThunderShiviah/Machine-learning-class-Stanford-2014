This folder contains my code for exercise 1 of the Stanford Machine Learning class. There are two main codes to run:
ex1.m runs a univariate gradient descent on data of profits of food carts vs city population.
ex1_multi.m runs a multivariate form of the same machine learning algorithm.

Code was written in GNU octave but can also be run using matlab.
To run:
octave ex1.m
or 
octave ex1_multi.m
